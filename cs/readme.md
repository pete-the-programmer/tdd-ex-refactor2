## Getting Started

This project uses .NET core style projects.  You may need the `dotnet` cli.

First restore the dependencies and build the project 

    dotnet restore
    dotnet build

... and then run the tests.

    dotnet test

All the tests should pass.  Note that there may be a warning that the `src` project doesn't contain any tests - it is safe to ignore this message.

Please follow the [main instructions](../README.md), and remember to run the tests often!
